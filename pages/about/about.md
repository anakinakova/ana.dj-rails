This is a work in progress.  Probably always will be.  I plan to use this space
for my own random notes and journal like posts.  I never seem to have time to
work on my own things. Why is that??  The colours I've managed to come up with
so far .. actually look pretty good with Flux at the moment ;).
I'll at least push this up because it's better than the mess I left.
Maybe I can work on this at Rails Camp if I don't get anywhere with the app!

Oh yeah .. and I was just gonna add my fur babies.

They were both adopted at the same time from the RSPCA in April 2013. They were
in the same enclosure and I figured they could keep each other company while I
was at work. It really has been good working from home twice a week though.

I used to always consider myself a _dog person_. I should really just call
myself an _animal person_. I have come to love these two fur balls more than I
thought was possible for a cat!
